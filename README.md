# Portfolio Project

This repository contains a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information.

- **style.css**: Contains the styles for the portfolio website, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the HTML elements.
  
- **script.js**: Intended for JavaScript functionality, which may include form validation, interactivity, or other dynamic features for the portfolio.
